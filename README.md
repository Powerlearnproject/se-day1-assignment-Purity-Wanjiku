#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of taking a problem, understanding its needs, and designing, building, and maintaining software solutions. It is important in the technology industry to enable innovation of how things are done, improve the efficiency of work, solve complex problems, and connect people through the use of social media applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s - this is the iterative and incremental method of software development practice.
2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s - By emulating control flow statements and data structures, this paradigm advocates for writing clean, efficient, and understandable code.
3. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s - The discipline focused on applying engineering principles to software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Plan and gather requirements - Gathering and documenting user requirements
2. Design - Creating a blueprint for the software's architecture
3. Development/Coding - Writing the actual code based on the design specifications
4. Testing - Identifying and fixing bugs and errors.
5. Deployment - Releasing the software to the market or end-users
6. Maintenance - Providing ongoing support and updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall - It is a linear sequential process where each phase must be completed before the next begins. 
Use cases: Projects with clear and stable requirements
Agile - It is an iterative development approach that emphasizes flexibility and customer collaboration. It involves breaking down a project into smaller cycles called sprints.
Use cases: Projects that require rapid delivery

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - They are responsible for translating design specifications into functional software applications.
Quality Assurance Engineer - They test the software to identify defects and ensure it meets the specified requirements.
Project Manager - They are responsible for planning, organizing, and managing resources to achieve project objectives.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - A software application that provides comprehensive facilities such as a text editor, debugger, and compiler for software development e.g. Visual Studio Code, PHPStorm
2. Version Control Systems (VCS) - a software tool that records changes to a file or set of files over time e.g. Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Tight deadlines often lead to rushed development, compromising quality - Effective time management, prioritizing tasks, breaking down projects into smaller manageable chunks and utilizing tracking tools.
2. Client or stakeholder requirements can change frequently, disrupting development plans - Regular communication with stakeholders, version control, and flexible design can help adapt to changes smoothly.
3. Maintaining high code quality while meeting deadlines can be difficult - Code reviews, automated testing, code style guides, and static analysis tools can help.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing - Verify that each unit works as expected in isolation.
2. Integration Testing - Verify that components work together as expected.
3. System Testing - Verify that the system meets specified requirements and functions correctly.
4. Acceptance Testing - Determine if the software is acceptable for delivery.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is understanding how to communicate with AI in a way that maximizes its potential. 
It's importance is to promote accuracy and relevance, ensure efficiency to save time and give control and direction of the AI response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: Create a resume as an entry-level software developer.
Improved: Create a one-page resume for a recent computer science graduate with proficiency in Python, JavaScript, and SQL, targeting a junior software developer position at a fintech startup.
